## About

We all heard the term *"dog years"*, or the phrase *"one year for your dog is seven years for you"*,
which simply means that your dog has a shorter life expectancy then you. 

Is there a way to be more precise then that? After all, 
small dogs live longer then large dogs. How about you have a cat or a bird?
Just enter the type of your pet and the date of birth and you will know its *"pet age"*.

Another way to look at this is that your pet lives a **faster** life, not a **shorter** one.
If you take the seven to one ratio as an example, it means that:
* one second for you is seven seconds for him, 
* one minute for you is seven minutes for him, 
* one hour for you is seven hours for him, 
* finally, he lives seven days in one of yours. 
 
All this information can be displayed on a clock whose hands move faster depending on the pet type. 
If you enter your pet's name and date of birth, the adjusted age will be calculated.
For reference, a second regular clock is shown. As you can see the time flies faster for your pet.  

The image below shows the graphical elements added to a regular clock.

##Technology

This project was generated is meant as an illustration of how to use the following technologies in an angular application:
* svg (with binding),
* d3 (animation of graphical elements),
* moment (complex date time calculations),
* angular material (info and settings tabs),
* angular flex-layout,
* redux (state management),
* local storage (persistent state).

The app can be viewed in action [here](https://ldrosu.github.io/PetClock/).
